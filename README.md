<h1>Milestone 4 – FAB, by Tiny - CI - Full Stack Frameworks with Django.</h1>
Project Idea: Build an ecommerce website to sell/hire party dresses and accessories.
This project is focused on both front and back end development skills.
I decided to go ahead with this idea based on a project that my sister has had for years.  
Fab, by Tiny is a fictitious online party dress, shoes and accessories store. 
The store has its own collection for sale but also gives the possibility to hire.
<h2>UX</h2>
This website is for people who are looking for designer dresses and accessories at an affordable price.

<h2>Fonts</h2>
<h3>Abril Fatface</h3>
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Abril+Fatface?query=abril+#standard-styles" target="_blank">Abril Fatface</a> is part of a bigger type family system, Abril, which includes 18 styles for all Display and Text uses. 
The titling weights are a contemporary revamp of classic Didone styles, display both neutrality and strong presence on the page to attract reader attention with measured tension by its curves, good color and high contrast.
Abril Fatface in particular is inspired by the heavy titling fonts used in advertising posters in 19th century Britain and France. 
The thin serifs and clean curves lend the typeface a refined touch that give any headline an elegant appearance. 
The Extended Latin character set supports over 50 languages, including those from Central and Northern Europe.
<h3>Open Sans</h3>
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open+sans#standard-styles" target="_blank">Open Sans</a> is a humanist sans serif typeface designed by Steve Matteson, Type Director of Ascender Corp. 
This version contains the complete 897 character set, which includes the standard ISO Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets. 
Open Sans was designed with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral, yet friendly appearance. 
It was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms.
